 Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install and run the CloudProject on your local machine using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

If you haven't installed Docker and Docker Compose yet, please visit the official Docker website and download the appropriate versions for your operating system.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install and run the CloudProject:

1. Clone the CloudProject repository by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AtefMMO/CloudProject.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd CloudProject
   ```

3. Build the Docker images for the backend and frontend applications using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

4. Start the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will download any required Docker images and create the necessary containers for the project.

5. Once the containers are up and running, open a web browser and visit [http://localhost:5000/persons](http://localhost:5000/persons) to access the frontend application.

   Note: Ensure that port 5000 is not being used by any other application on your machine.
